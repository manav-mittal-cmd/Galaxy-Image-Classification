# Galaxy-Image-Classification

This project trains a pre-trained model to classify galaxy images by their morphoological features, i.e. shape.

The galaxies are classified into Spiral, Elliptical, and Barred Spiral. 

The model has an ~86% training accuracy. 

A front end for the project is available by running the command ```streamlit run frontEnd.py```.
